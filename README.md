# Google Calendar Material Design

Inspired by:
- [Ink for Google™](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ink-for-google/hmanckoiohnlgdommlcckcflkmllobgj)
- [cleanGoogleCalendar by @Gambloide](https://gist.github.com/Gambloide/a5ed244df001039bb7e4)

## Why?

1. Ink for Google did a great job at improving the Calendar design. But it isn’t finished yet.
2. CleanGoogleCalendar by @Gambloide improves the events layout
3. I added CSS to improve some edit windows.

## How to use?

### 1A. In browser - Download the Stylish extension: [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe), [Safari](http://sobolev.us/stylish/), 
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/?src=external-userstyleshome), 
[Opera](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/stylish/)

Then search for ‘Google Calendar Material’ in the Stylish public library. Done! (Or insert the custom CSS manually from step 2).

### 1B. Standalone Mac App - Download Fluid App
- Download [Fluid App](http://fluidapp.com) to transform any web page into a native Mac App.
- Pay for the license to enable ‘Userstyles’.
- Download the Google Calendar app icon
- Create a standalone app for URL calendar.google.com named ‘Google Calendar’ and use the custom app icon.
- Insert custom CSS from step 2 (**Window → Userscripts**)

### 2. Insert custom CSS
Edit your custom styles and add these stylesheets:
1. 
2. 
3. 

Enjoy!
